		    		<h3>About Edo State EduAPP</h3>
		    		<p>With the growing amounts of Open Educational Resources available online, finding the right resource to make decisions as a user depending on interest in Edo State poses a challenge. Surmounting this challenge, the Edo State Government via the Information Communications Technology Agency (ICTA) has designed the Edo State EduApp to suit this and other related challenges.
			        </p>
			        <p>The Edo State EduApp is an application designed to make a visual representation of government’s investment in education, school infrastructure, teachers, students and pupil’s statistics as well as budget and budget implementations. This is done to aid education stakeholders in making optimal decisions via a transparent and viable platform.
			        </p>
			        <p>
			        	The application seeks to provide a veritable tool to the government for improved decision making on education, improved quality of education in the state, citizens easy access to information on education for decision making, and showcase of Open Data Team’s Capability.
			        </p>
			        <p>
			        	It utilizes data on school location, school infrastructure, student/pupil enrolment, teachers and principal distribution, student pass rates, education budget and budget expenditure. With these, the app will help in creating transparency in the educational sector, providing a platform for a better informed citizenry, ensuring proper monitoring of the sector by the government and its officials, creating more informed decisions by policy makers, creating healthy competition among schools and providing a ground of the planning process for an improved educational standard.
